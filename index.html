                My name is Claire and I was born and raised in San Diego. I’m an artist, an activist, and a small
                business owner. I got my start as a trans activist in my community in San Diego and starting this
                business in 2016 was a continuation of fulfilling that goal. I have since moved to Portland, Oregon
                to
                build a life and help more people reach their hair removal goals!
                I’m a licensed electrologist that has been practicing for over 7 years. I specialize in facial hair
                removal for trans women and pre-surgical hair removal for all forms of gender affirming surgery.
                However, I work on all people regardless of gender. Permanent hair removal is a passion of mine and
                I
                hope I get to share it with you! You are in excellent hands, so book a free consultation now!
